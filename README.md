PROJECT TITLE


Autoencoder-Driven-Generative-AI-with-Kalman-Filters



Overview

This project focuses on developing a lightweight text processing model leveraging Autoencoders and Kalman Filters to address the computational limitations of generative AI models like ChatGPT and LLaMA.

Key Features

Efficient Design:

Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder for sentence reconstruction.
Compact latent representation for semantic and structural encoding.
Robust noise mitigation with Kalman Filters.

Core Functionalities:

Text classification, sentiment analysis, and sequence modeling.
Real-time processing on resource-constrained devices.


Objectives


Minimize reconstruction loss for accurate sentence representation.
Combine generative techniques with advanced noise filtering for robust performance.
Develop a scalable, efficient model for low-power edge devices.


Methodology

Autoencoder:

LSTM-based encoder-decoder with embedding layers for word mapping.
Sparse categorical cross-entropy for loss minimization.
Kalman Filters:

Refines latent representations and mitigates noise.
Enhances adaptability for real-time applications.

Training Setup:

Dataset of 20,000 tokens with padding and out-of-vocabulary markers.
Optimized using Adam optimizer with custom loops.
50 epochs of training with temperature-based sampling for diversity.

Results


Achieved high semantic fidelity and grammatical coherence in reconstructed sentences.
Demonstrated strong performance in capturing relationships and handling noisy data.

Future Work


Explore pruning, quantization, and model distillation for edge deployment.
Extend to multilingual datasets, machine translation, and summarization.
Integrate lightweight pretrained embeddings like FastText or GloVe.


Contributions to Generative AI


This approach bridges the gap between high-performance generative models and resource-constrained devices, ensuring real-time, efficient text processing without reliance on heavy computational resources.
